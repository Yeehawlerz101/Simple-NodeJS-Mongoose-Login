# Why?
Well As I needed a simple login but the kept the integregity of security I stumbled onto his article and it worked awesomely but there was no real simple tutorial for setting it up from a complete newbie to Mongo DB.
 ### What does this acclompish?
 So I've modified his code slightly so the user submits their signup date, expire date and if they had a referral code (based off of the custom page). So this will create a entry for mongo DB that has their creation date, login name hashed password, subscription expiration date and who signed them up (if the box was filled).
# Requirements

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
## Steps
 1. clone the repo and run "npm init" tosetup the dependicies.
 2. Startup mongoDB and setit for a no authentication on the local system for port 27017
 3.
